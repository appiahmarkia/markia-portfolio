    <h2>About Markia</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      I’m a Graphic Designer and digital creative with 7+ years of experience across branding, advertising,
      social content, and UX/UI-oriented visuals. My work is rooted in education, community, and service-based brands.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      I’ve built brand systems and campaigns for Bakari Academy (an Afrocentric micro-school), Girls Gracefully Growing
      (a mommy–daughter community and event series), and Appiah Transportation (a ride-share concept focused on families).
      Across all of these, I focus on clarity, warmth, and visuals that actually support how people use the products and services.

    <h2>About Markia</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      I’m a Graphic Designer and digital creative with 7+ years of experience across branding, advertising,
      social content, and UX/UI-oriented visuals. My work is rooted in education, community, and service-based brands.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      I’ve built brand systems and campaigns for Bakari Academy (an Afrocentric micro-school), Girls Gracefully Growing
      (a mommy–daughter community and event series), and Appiah Transportation (a ride-share concept focused on families).
      Across all of these, I focus on clarity, warmth, and visuals that actually support how people use the products and services.

    I’m currently open to remote graphic design and marketing design roles, as well as select
    freelance collaborations. If you’re looking for someone who can own branding, social assets,
    and UX-informed visuals for campaigns or products, I’d love to connect.
